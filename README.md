# Cor-Tech Innovations AI Lab

This repository serves as the official portfolio and development lab for my AI prototypes and projects. As the **Lead Innovation Architect**, I use this space to build, test, and showcase solutions that bridge the gap between AI, cloud infrastructure, and cybersecurity.

## 🚀 AI-102 Prototypes (My "Prototype-to-Pass" Plan)

This section contains the hands-on projects I built while preparing for the AI-102 (Azure AI Engineer) certification. Each prototype solves a specific business problem and demonstrates mastery of a core Azure AI service.

### Prototype 1: CMMC Compliance Bot (Azure AI Foundry)

* **Project:** Designed and deployed a secure, **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** agent in **Azure AI Foundry (AI Studio)** to serve as a CMMC Compliance Bot.
* **Accomplishment:** Engineered a robust system prompt ("Instructions") to ground the `gpt-4o` model, ensuring it *only* answered questions based on private CMMC documentation and securely refused all off-topic queries.
* **Skills:** `Azure AI Foundry`, `Generative AI`, `RAG`, `Prompt Engineering`, `Security & Grounding`
